# K-means:

We made a Basic Implementation of K-means Clustering Algorithm for our mini-project of 1st Semester.
But what was challenging was making it more visual in C language.

So we decided that the output from the C program would be the codes for EPS image files that can be parsed with Corel Draw or any online
converters that can convert .EPS to .JPEG. The reason for selecting .eps file is that is based on vector imaging, and we get many 
advantage over raster imaging :)
